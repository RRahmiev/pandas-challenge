Module 4 Challenge – Report

•	Summarize the analysis:

o	The first data set used for this analyses summarizes 15 schools of a district of 2 different types – District and Charter schools. 
o	The data also includes the sizes and budgets of the schools.
o	The second data set covers all students within these 15 schools and their grades in math and reading
o	After processing, the data shows all schools have a very similar budget – between 580 and 680 per student but they do vary in size more widely – from less than 1000 students up to 5000.
o	The results for the reading and math grades shows a good performance in both math and reading for all schools
o	Students from all schools achieved more than 70% on average in math and more than 80% in reading
o	The overall pass rate however is varies between 52 and 91%.

•	Conclusions/Observations:

o	All 5 of the best performing schools in this data set are Charter schools.
o	On the other hand, the 5 worse performing schools are District schools.
o	The top 5 best performing schools are also significantly smaller in size, with the biggest having 2283 students, whereas the biggest of the bottom 5 performing schools has 4761 students – more than double.
o	The data also shows that math and reading scores are almost constant throughout 9th to 12th grade for all 15 schools.
o	The schools with a smaller budget per student have a much higher overall pace rate than the better funded ones.
o	Smaller schools outperform bigger schools in terms of overall pass rates.
